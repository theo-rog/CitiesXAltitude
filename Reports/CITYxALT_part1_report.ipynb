    "\n",
    "The primary dataset used is the simplemaps dataset [1]. The simplemaps dataset does not contain elevation, the elevation is extracted from the secondary dataset, geonames [2] . The two datasets to not share the same unique identifier for each city - it is necessary to join based on the city name and country. This doesn't provide a unique match for each city, so the population and latitude/longitude are used to identify matches. Part 1 of this project aims to merge the 2 datasets.\n",

    "### Dataset 1: simplemaps\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplemaps dataset was used for the following reasons:\n",
    "- Recentness: the dataset was last updated on 11/5/25 (Same time as the commencement of this project)\n",
    "- Simplicity: population, city and city name are all given with one row per entry\n",
    "- Size: there are approximately 48,000 cities in the dataset which is both comprehensive, and not overwhelmingly large \n",
    "- Source: the dataset is built from reputable sources (NGIA, US Geological Survey, US Census Bureau, and NASA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon critical evaluation, the sources are all tied to entities associated with the United States, which may give a biased or inaccurate representation of international cities. However, given that this dataset measures population and location, one can assume there is very minimal bias introduced from the geopolitical climate of the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon regarding the visualisation of the dataset by location (as given by simplemaps, [1]):\n",

    "Without delving into the full complexities of international population density, several observations can be drawn from Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly there seems to be bias, with a very strong density of cities in the United States, the United Kingdom and South Eastern Europe. Whilst these are densely populated areas, it does seem as though these cities may be over-represented, perhaps due to ease of access of information. This is acknowledged, and will be taken into account in any conclusions drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, one can identify that there is data on North Korea (as well as other regions, with a complex geopolitical situation). It is hard to verify data from North Korea, due to the complexities of the region. It is possible there is data here that may be misleading or inaccurate. Due to North Korea's smaller representation in the dataset, it is likely that bias will be negligible, however it is acknowledged.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is sparsity of towns in certain regions (like North Africa, Siberia, and central Australia) however this is very consistent with these areas being largely uninhabitable due to deserts other conditions. \n",

    "\n",
    "The simplemaps dataset, does not include information on altitude/elevation. It's consequently necessary to introduce another dataset to join on. This is the geonames dataset (cities 1000) [2]. The dataset chosen is the cities1000.txt dataset, to include every city with a population over 1000.\n",

    "\n",
    "A slightly different means of visualising cities was chosen to the visualisation provided by simplemaps. Notably, an increased size and transparency of mark was chosen to represent cities due to the increased number of cities (approximately 150,000) in the dataset. The larger dataset makes visualising each city by a point more challenging, consequentially more transparent yet larger marks are used to give a better impression of density of coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 shows a broader coverage of cities than Figure 1, with greater density of coverage in places like India, Europe and Thailand. However the presentation style can be misleading to appear to have a greater frequency of cities. This map again shows bias, with disproportionately high density in Europe and the United States. This perhaps reflects the bias of the availability of geographical data, and matches general trends in Figure 1.\n",

It is consequentially possible to use those measures to match cities. However, it is not as simple as matching exact numbers as there is some disparity in population and location between datasets. One can assume that two cities are the same if they have \"similar\" population and location, this notion leads to the following investigation. The goal is to \"match\" cities to themselves between datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"match\" in this project refers to the combination of entries from both datasets, of a city which can be uniquely identified in both datasets. \n",

    "Denote the simplemaps and geonames datasets each as (simplemaps) and (geonames). (City, Country_code) is used to refer to an entry in either dataset.\n",

    "On the other hand, if there are $n$ (Springfield, US)s $\\in$ (simplemaps), and $m$ (Springfield, US)s $\\in$ (geonames). Label these as (Springfield, US)$_i$ $\\in$ (simplemaps) for $i = 1,...,n$ and (Springfield, US)$_j$ $\\in$ (geonames) for $j = 1,...,m$. There are $m\\dot n$ \"potential matches\" of (Springfield, US)$_i$ $\\times$ (Springfield, US)$_j$ $\\in$ (simplemaps $\\times$ geonames) $\\forall i,j$. The goal is then to deduce which potential matches are actual matches. This can be done using data available in the datasets (population and location) or manual validation.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Sample Cities: Known Matches\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine how cities should be matched, two sample sets are chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first sample set can be used to identify how population and coordinates vary in known matched cities. This set should:\n",
    "    - Have cities that are likely to be unique in their own country (so they can be verified as matches) \n",
    "    - Represent a broad range of cities, by both population and location (to investigate all kinds of disparities)\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of cities was sampled from an LLM. The LLM was prompted to give a sample of random cities (which are unique by name in their own country) that covered all continents (excluding Antarctica and including the Middle East) and varying sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM was used:\n",
    "    - to reduce human bias\n",
    "    - for the knowledge of place names that are likely to be without repeats - a human (myself) would be unlikely to have such a broad knowledge set\n",
    "\n",
    "For ethics, the output was verified by a human (myself) and was concluded to be a good representation of the dataset. The uniqueness of each location is inspected further.\n",

    "\n",

    "The only cities in this list that have multiple entries in either dataset are Springfield in the US (11 counts in simplemaps, 20 in geonames) and San Jose (1 count in simplemaps, 2 counts in geonames). Since the other cities have verifiable matches between datasets, they are included in the first sample set. These cities may introduce a slight bias towards cities in the Americas. This bias is likely to be negligible as the selection of cities is fairly arbitrary, and positively impacts the diversity of the sample set.\n",
    "\n",

The Springfields are analysed for preliminary analysis of how disparities manifest (so the San Joses are dropped from the dataset). Since matches are assumed to be injective, there is a maximum of 11 matches between the Springfields (assuming each Springfield in the simplemaps dataset is in the geonames dataset) and a minimum of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurements of Similarity: Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "It is necessary to outline how to measure the similarity in population and location between a city in both datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "When matching distance, it may be sensical to use the co-ordinates to directly distance (perhaps Manhattan distance, or Euclidean). The Earth, however, is spherical - measuring distance with latitude/longitude would bias distances between cities that are further from the equator.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to measure the distance between two co-ordinate points. This is achieved through the Haversine formula. Which is used to measure distance between two points modelling the Earth as a sphere. The formula is widely used in geospatial analysis and uses the Earth's radius (approximately 6371km) and trigonometric functions. The exact details are omitted for brevity, but the formula is given in geonames_vis.ipynb. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurements of Similarity: Population\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring similarity in population may sound more simple. However areas with larger populations are likely to have different magnitudes of population difference. An example is Alice Springs in Australia (verified match) which has populations of 23,726 and 25,186 in the simplemaps and geonames datasets respectively (1,460 difference). On the other hand, a much larger city like Hanoi (verified match) has populations of 8,587,100 and 8,053,663 (533,437 difference) which is much larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be impossible to determine a static boundary on population difference to determine if there is a match, without introducing bias against smaller cities. Instead, one might be inclined to use ratios of population. For example for Alice Springs and Hanoi, the simplemaps population differs from the geonames population by 6.2% and 6.6% respectively, and shows that the populations don't differ too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a statistic that is invariant in both scale, and order of population, the following is used: $$\\text{ALPR}(x_1,x_2) = \\text{exp}(\\left | \\log\\left(\\frac{x_1}{x_2} \\right) \\right|)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x_1$ = population according to simplemaps and $x_2$ = population according to geonames (these are both values > 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "For $\\alpha >0$ it can be shown that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{ALPR}(x, \\alpha x) = \\exp\\left( \\left| \\log\\left( \\frac{x}{\\alpha x} \\right) \\right| \\right) = \\exp\\left( |\\log(\\alpha^{-1})| \\right) =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\alpha, & \\text{if } \\alpha \\geq 1 \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{1}{\\alpha}, & \\text{if } 0<\\alpha < 1\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The converse, $ALPR(x,\\alpha x)$ can be shown to give the same result, showing the symmetry of the function. These results show the ALPR is an effective, scale invariant measure of population ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponents and logarithms are all calculated in base 10, but are arbitrary as the cancel out in the derivation. The outer exponent isn't entirely necessary, but is used to make the output on the same scale as the ratio itself, making the output more interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is henceforth referred to the \"Absolute Log Population Ratio\" (ALPR). Cities with a population of 0 are considered to be incomplete data, and are consequentially not used, ensuring no dividing by 0 errors. It can be shown that the log population ratio is invariant under labelling (through splitting the logarithm, taking out a factor of -1, and then merging the logarithms).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the ALPR between Alice Springs is 1.061, and Hanoi, 1.065. This score indicates high similarity, showing that these populations are on the same scale. Contrarily, a mismatched pair, like between Hanoi in the simplemaps dataset and Alice Springs in the geonames dataset gives an ALPR of 5.832. This larger score indicates that the two populations are on different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the difference in populations of Tokyo is 28,051,724. (This is likely due to the one dataset measuring the central Tokyo area, compared to the Greater Tokyo area). This can be considered an outlier, but is likely to occur with other major cities. This problem is noted and taken into account further downstream.\n",

It is possible that there are some potential matches that fall in cluster that are false matches. This is because they have not all been manually verified - however it is unlikely there is an overwhelming amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cluster that lies above the boundary is comprised mostly of non-green points, indicating that these points are mostly ambiguous - however this is not sufficient to determine these are false matches. The green points in this cluster indicate either:\n",
    "- There are (City, Country_code) entries that are unique in both datasets, but do not refer to the same place (for example: the green points that are $10^{4} = 10000\\text{km}$ away)\n",
    "- There are some correct matches that are falsely identified as incorrect, according to the distance boundary (potentially the cities that fall just short of the boundary)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both cases show that this is a non-perfect method. This cluster has a broader spread of population, with greater difference reflecting the ambiguity of these potential matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this project were to approach with more rigour, one could:\n",
    " - Apply clustering or classification techniques\n",
    " - Impose Gaussian distributions on the clusters (which seems like it would be successful) and cluster according to GMMs\n",
    " - Compare quantiles of a Gaussian distribution and the clusters to validate use of GMMs\n",
    " - Use a more rigorous training/testing construction, this project only loosely follows these notions\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset of \"True\" matches is created by including every match with cities that are within 30km of each other. It is necessary to validate the uniqueness of matches in this dataset before proceeding to part 2 of this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "An SQL query (as in section 5 in database.sqbpro) reveals that there are 194 matches with duplicate IDs in the dataset of 31344 matches. Assuming that every other city is correctly matched, this gives (an assumed) precision of 99.38% which can be thought of as very successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigating the false positive matches shows a few places of note that slipped through the cracks: \n",
    "\n",
    "The match associated with the Springfields in Pennsylvania. This is consistent with the prior investigation, which showed that these two cities were suburbs of Philadelphia. These two cities are unusually close and show just how common the city name \"Springfield\" is in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kansas City, US also proved problematic. This is due to the fact that this city is interestingly divided into two districts, as it lies directly on a state boundary. The Western district is considered part of Kansas and the Eastern, part of Missouri. Thus the existence of two \"Kansas Cities\" right next to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is acknowledged that these cities could be aggregated or de-duplicated, however these cities form less than 1% of the dataset. It is justifiable to remove them as any further investigation could introduce unnecessary complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "From Figure 6, it is clear a boundary of 30km works well. The resulting dataset (with duplicate filtering) is used in part 2, which aims to explore the relationship between altitude and population of cities. This dataset can be used with trust in the simplemaps dataset, with added information provided by the geonames dataset. The matching between areas helps to create a dataset which can be used effectively in part 2.\n",

    "If you are reading this, part 2 is still not complete, and this report may undergo tweaking and refinement to support further conclusions in part 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "As of June 2025, I intend on focussing my efforts on another project, to maintain/build a broad skill set.\n",
